Package fancyhdr Warning: \headheight is too small (12.0pt): 
(fancyhdr)                Make it at least 27.11232pt, for example:
(fancyhdr)                \setlength{\headheight}{27.11232pt}.
(fancyhdr)                You might also make \topmargin smaller:
(fancyhdr)                \addtolength{\topmargin}{-15.11232pt}.

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
